# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a Bachelor of Science degree specialising in data science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is compulsory for my degree, but I also really enjoy stats and am excited to learn more about it.
- I am interested in learning about how we combine different technologies and tools to best understand and present data to others.
